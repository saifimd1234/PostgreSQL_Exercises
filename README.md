# 🚀 PostgreSQL Exercises - SQL Mastery 🎯

Welcome to my PostgreSQL Exercises repository! 🌟 Here, you'll find my solutions to a series of SQL challenges designed to sharpen my skills in relational databases and PostgreSQL. These exercises are taken from [PGExercises](https://pgexercises.com), a fantastic platform to practice and improve SQL proficiency through real-world datasets.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains:
- ✅ Solutions to SQL queries, from basic `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses to advanced concepts like `JOINs`, `WINDOW` functions, aggregations, and recursive queries.
- 🗂️ Well-structured queries that adhere to industry standards and are optimized for performance.
- 🧠 Insightful comments within each query file, explaining the logic and approach.

## 🎯 Skills Acquired

Throughout this journey, I have gained hands-on experience with:
- **SQL Fundamentals**: Basic querying, filtering, and sorting data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.
- **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables with `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL OUTER` joins.
- **Aggregations & Grouping**: Using functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY` to summarize data.
- **Window Functions**: Applying `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `OVER()`, and other window functions for more sophisticated analysis.
- **Conditional Queries**: Implementing `CASE` statements for dynamic results based on different conditions.
- **Subqueries & CTEs**: Writing nested queries and using `WITH` (Common Table Expressions) for cleaner, modular queries.
- **Recursive Queries**: Tackling hierarchical data using recursive SQL techniques.

## 💼 How I Can Apply These Skills

The exercises here demonstrate my ability to:
- Analyze and manipulate data in relational databases.
- Design efficient queries to solve complex business problems.
- Work with large datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- Perform data transformations and aggregations, essential for data analysis roles.

These skills are essential in the field of data analytics, enabling me to contribute to roles involving data extraction, manipulation, and reporting. 💻 As a fresher in data analytics, I am confident that my knowledge in SQL will help me effectively analyze datasets and deliver actionable insights.
